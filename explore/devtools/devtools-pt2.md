1) The bug in the code is the declaration of the variables and the data types of the inputs. We can see through debugging on our DevTools that the erroneous result is caused since num1 and num2 read the inputs as strings instead of ints. When the addition operation is performed, instead of adding the numbers, it concatenates the two strings. This causes the result to be a string containing the two numbers instead of the actual sum of the function. 
2) I fixed the bug by type converting the variables that store the inputs. This is done using the Number() method, which type casts any input into its respective int value. My implementation is include in screenshots.
